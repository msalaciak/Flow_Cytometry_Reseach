# Flow_Cytometry_Reseach
Machine Learning Applied to Flow Cytometry Data

In colloboration with researchers at the CHU Sainte-Justine hôpital mère enfant de Montréal.
This research is focusing on applying machine learning algorithms on raw data from flow cytometry data FCS files of Lymphoma patients.

Currently focusing on the raw data, eventually will explore working with CV and the actual cytometry images.
